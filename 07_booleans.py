# Booleans are one of the keys to making programs that do
# things by leting us compare values.

# The boolean operaters return True if the expression 
# evaluates to true and False if the expression evaluates to
# false

# Test if two values are the same:
5 == 5
# True

# Test if two values are NOT the same:
5 != 5
# False

# Test if one value is less than another
5 < 6
# True

# Test if one value is greater than another
5 > 6
# False

# Less than or equal to 
5 <= 6
# True

#  greater than or equal to
5 >= 6
# False
