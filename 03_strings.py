# Strings are formed with double or single quotes
myString = "Hello, how are you today?"
myString = 'Hello, how are you today?'

# Sometimes you will want an apostrophe inside a string. You 
# can either use a \ to "escape" the quote, or double quotes 
# to make the string:
testString = "This is Paul's car."
testString2 = 'This is Paul\'s car.'
# The \ tells python not to interpret the ' as part of the
# syntax

# Note that you cannot close a string using a different quote
# type than you started it with, which would cause an error:
testString3 = "Hello!'
