# NLTK is a library that contains many functions that will be 
# useful for us in this class. 

# You can find many excellent excersizes and a lot of 
# information at https://www.nltk.org/book/ (some of this)
# tutorial is based on this book. 


# First, we need to download some extra files:
import nltk

# You only need to run this once. Once the files are installed
# you will not need to run this again
nltk.download()

# Just select "popular," which offers a nice balance between
# disk space and utility. When it is finished, close the
# window
