# Conventionally, function definitions occur at the top of
# your code

# Your functions can have as many inputs as you like

# Just put the input inside the parantheses
def whoseFunction(yourname, myname):
    print(f"Hi, {yourname}! My name is {myname}!")

# Now give the function both inputs
whoseFunction("Paul", "Pim")
