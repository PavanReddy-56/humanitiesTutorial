This repository contains all of the code we will cover in the Fall 2018 edition of my Hacking the Humanities class, which I teach at Leiden University as part of the Digital Humanities minor program.

This code accompanies a series of videos that I am filming (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6kqrM2i6BPIpEF5yHPNkYhjHm-FYWh17). The goal is to create a resource for students so we can spend less time in class talking about the technical details of coding and more about how we can use this code to study human culture.

While this should serve as a functional introduction to Python, it is not meant to be comprehensive. Instead, it is designed to help students with no knowledge of coding at all learn how to do text analysis and data visualization.

This code is written assuming you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 (and should be compatible with Python 3.6 and up).

As of July 2018, this remains a work in progress. I will update this readme once the code is complete.

# Note
Code in the stylometry files opens texts from a folder called "corpus." This folder is created by code in the 20_corpusrep1_dividing.py, so run that before you try to run the stylometry code. The two fed (federalist papers) examples do NOT require this corpus folder, so feel free to run those immediately.

# Updates
Renamed files to aid organization. Added DataFrames, Corpus Basics, matplotlib, stylometry

# TO DO
topic modeling
word2vec
apis and webscraping
