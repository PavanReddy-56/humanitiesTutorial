This repository contains all of the code we will cover in the Fall 2018 edition of my Hacking the Humanities class, which I teach at Leiden University as part of the Digital Humanities minor program.

This code will accompany a series of videos that I am filming. The goal is to create a resource for students so we can spend less time in class talking about the technical details of coding and more about how we can use this code to study human culture.

While this should serve as a functional introduction to Python, it is not meant to be comprehensive. Instead, it is designed to help students with no knowledge of coding at all learn how to do text analysis and data visualization.

This code is written assuming you have installed the Anaconda distribution of Python 3 (and should be compatible with Python 3.6 and up).

As of July 2018, this remains a work in progress. I will update this readme once the code is complete.
