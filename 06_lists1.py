# Python has a number of other, more comlicated datatypes
# Here, we will talk about lists

# A list is a datatype that is an ordered container for 
# information,

# Create with square brackets and seperate each item with a
# comma
myList = ["Juan", "Rogier","Ying"]

# A list can be empty
emptyList = []

# It can contain basic datatypes:
intList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
floatList = [1.1,1.2,1.3]

# You can mix datatypes:
mixedList = [1, "hello", 4.4]

# You can also have a list of lists
listList = [[1,1], [2,1], [8,0]]
