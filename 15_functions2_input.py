# While you can simply write functions with no input
# it is easy to add inputs:

# Just put the input inside the parantheses
def whoseFunction(name):
    print(f"Hi, {name}! Nice function!")

# call the function and give it an input value:
# Python takes the value an inserts it into the function
whoseFunction("Paul")
whoseFunction("Pim")
