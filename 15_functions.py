# Coding is all about making things easier for ourselves
# Some times you will be writing the same code over and 
# over again. When this happens, it is often best to write
# a function.

# functions are defined with the def keyword:

def paulsFunction():
    # anything inside the function will execute when I call it
    print("Hello! Nice function!")

# To run the code, just call the function
paulsFunction()
